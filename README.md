VS Debugger Visualizer for Aspose.Words.

This is (yet) a simple Visual Studio Debugger Visualizer that allows you to see the structure of all Aspose.Words.Node in an XML format to allow easier understanding of what your document looks like while debugging. Please raise a github [issue](https://github.com/philippdolder/AsposeVisualizer/issues) if you are missing anything.

Currently there is a zip file release available for current versions of Aspose.Words (downloadable from [Aspose](http://www.aspose.com/community/files/487065/download.aspx)).
